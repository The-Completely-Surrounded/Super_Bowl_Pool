# Quick Start (For Non-Technical Users)

This project is a simple Super Bowl Pool website that runs on any basic web host with PHP.

## Option A: Easiest Setup (Recommended)

1. Get a web host that supports PHP 8+ (GoDaddy, Bluehost, SiteGround, etc.).
2. Upload the contents of the release package to a folder on your site (example: `yourdomain.com/pool`).
3. Open `setup.php` in your browser: `https://yourdomain.com/pool/setup.php`.
4. Fill in the form (title, price, payment links) and click Save.
5. Delete `setup.php` from the server after setup (security).
6. Visit the pool URL and share it with your community.

## Option B: Manual Config (Still Easy)

1. Upload the files to your web host.
2. Copy `config.sample.json` to `config.json`.
3. Edit `config.json` in a text editor and update your details.
4. Visit the pool URL.
