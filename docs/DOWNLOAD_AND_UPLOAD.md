# Download + Upload (Super Simple)

This is the fastest way if you do not want to build anything.

## 1) Download the ZIP from GitHub

- Click the green **Code** button on GitHub
- Choose **Download ZIP**
- Unzip it on your computer

## 2) Find the Release Package Folder

Inside the repo you just unzipped:

- Open `release_package/`
- You should see: `index.html`, `assets/`, `api.php`, `setup.php`, `config.sample.json`

## 3) Upload to Your Web Host

- Create a new folder on your host (example: `/pool`)
- Upload **everything** from `release_package/` into that folder

## 4) Run the Installer

Go to:

```
https://yourdomain.com/pool/setup.php
```

Fill in the form, save, and then delete `setup.php`.

## 5) Share Your Pool

Your pool is now live at:

```
https://yourdomain.com/pool/
```
